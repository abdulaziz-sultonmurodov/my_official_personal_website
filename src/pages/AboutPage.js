            My full name is Abdulaziz Sultonmurodov Akmalovich and I am 19. I
            was born and live in Tashkent. I am an easy-going and talkative
            person. I try to solve problems as fast as I can and help people if
            I have opportunity to help them. I like to finish all the work I
            have then, I go and relax. I cannot take a rest until I complete my
            work.

            I finished studying international school named "Tashkent Ulugbek
            International School" (TUIS). I learned English in my school because
            all subjects were taught in English by foreign teachers. Then I
            graduated The Academic Lyceum of The World Economy and diplomacy
            University in 2017. Afterwards, I entered The Webster University in
            Tashkent in 2019. Now I am a sophomore student majoring in
            Economics.

            I have been learning frontend development for 1.5 years and have
            much experience in this field. I also started to have interest in
            backend development and have been learning for 6 months but do not
            have much experience. I have worked in an IT company for 1 month and
            have experience on working with team.

            In my spare time, I love learning new languages and know some basics
            in Spanish and Arabic. I really like playing football and tennis. I
            like reading books such as novels or stories and it helps me to
            develop my skills and ideas.
